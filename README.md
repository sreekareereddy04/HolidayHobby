# Maximum Subarray Sum Finder

Hey there! 👋 As part of my holiday coding hobby, I tackled the classic "Maximum Subarray Sum" problem using two different approaches. Here's what I've created:

## 🧐 Problem Statement
Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## 🛠️ My Solutions

### 1. Brute Force Approach (`Main.java`)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²)
- **How it works**: Checks every possible subarray combination
- **Pros**: Simple to understand
- **Cons**: Not efficient for large arrays

### 2. Optimal Kadane's Algorithm (`KadaneAlgorithm.java`)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - lightning fast! ⚡
- **How it works**: Smartly tracks maximum sum in a single pass
- **Pros**: Extremely efficient
- **Cons**: Slightly trickier to understand at first

## 🚀 Why This Matters
This was a great exercise in understanding:
- How different algorithms solve the same problem
- The importance of time complexity
- The beauty of optimization in code

## 💡 What I Learned
- The power of algorithm optimization
- How to implement Kadane's Algorithm
- The dramatic difference between O(n²) and O(n) solutions

## 🎯 Try It Yourself
Feel free to clone and test with different arrays! Which approach do you prefer?

Happy coding! 💻✨

*P.S. Holiday coding is the best coding - no deadlines, just pure learning fun!* 🎄☕
